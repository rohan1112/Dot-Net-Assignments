# Just-In-Time (JIT) Compilation

Just-In-Time (JIT) compilation is a key feature of the Common Language Runtime (CLR) in the .NET Framework, responsible for converting intermediate language (IL) code into native machine code at runtime.

## What is JIT Compilation?

- **On-Demand Compilation**: Instead of compiling the entire .NET program ahead of time, JIT compilation converts IL code into native machine code as needed during the execution of the program.

- **Optimization**: JIT compilers can apply optimizations specific to the runtime environment and the hardware architecture of the system, resulting in efficient and performant code execution.

## How JIT Compilation Works:

1. **IL Code Generation**: When a .NET program is compiled, it's translated into IL code, which is platform-independent bytecode.

2. **JIT Compilation**: When the program is executed, the CLR's JIT compiler analyzes the IL code and converts it into native machine code specific to the underlying hardware.

3. **Execution**: The native machine code is then executed by the processor, resulting in the execution of the program.
