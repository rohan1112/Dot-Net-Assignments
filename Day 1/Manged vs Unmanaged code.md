# Managed vs Unmanaged Code

Managed and unmanaged code are two different approaches to writing and executing software, with distinct characteristics and implications for developers.

## Managed Code

- **Definition**: Managed code refers to code that runs within the context of a managed runtime environment, such as the Common Language Runtime (CLR) in the .NET Framework.
- **Characteristics**:
  - **Memory Management**: Managed code relies on the runtime environment for memory management, including tasks like memory allocation and garbage collection.
  - **Security**: Managed code is subject to security restrictions enforced by the runtime environment, such as code access security.
  - **Language Interoperability**: Managed code supports multiple programming languages that can interoperate seamlessly within the same application.
  - **Portability**: Managed code can run on any system with a compatible runtime environment, regardless of the underlying hardware or operating system.

## Unmanaged Code

- **Definition**: Unmanaged code refers to code that is executed directly by the operating system without the assistance of a managed runtime environment.
- **Characteristics**:
  - **Memory Management**: Developers are responsible for managing memory manually, including tasks like memory allocation and deallocation.
  - **Security**: Unmanaged code has fewer security restrictions compared to managed code, as it operates outside the controlled environment of a runtime.
  - **Language Interoperability**: Unmanaged code is typically written in a single programming language and may have limited interoperability with other languages.
  - **Platform Specificity**: Unmanaged code may be tightly coupled to a specific hardware architecture or operating system, limiting its portability.
