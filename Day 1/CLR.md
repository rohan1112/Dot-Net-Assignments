# Common Language Runtime (CLR)

The Common Language Runtime (CLR) is a key component of the .NET Framework responsible for managing the execution of code written for the framework.

## What is CLR?

- **Runtime Environment**: CLR is like a virtual machine that provides an execution environment for .NET programs.
- **Intermediary Language (IL)**: .NET programs are compiled into an intermediate language called IL or bytecode, which CLR then translates into machine code specific to the computer it's running on.

## Key Functions:

1. **Memory Management**: CLR manages memory allocation and deallocation, ensuring efficient memory usage and preventing memory leaks.
2. **Code Execution**: It handles the execution of .NET programs, including loading assemblies, just-in-time compilation, and garbage collection.

3. **Exception Handling**: CLR provides a robust mechanism for handling exceptions, ensuring that programs can gracefully recover from errors.

4. **Security**: It enforces security policies to ensure that .NET programs run safely and securely, protecting against unauthorized access and malicious code.
